# Contributing to the debloat tools

Thanks for helping more TVs lose their ads. Two kinds of contributions are especially welcome.
For the launcher itself, see [vibe-launcher/CONTRIBUTING.md](../vibe-launcher/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 1. Add your TV model

Every brand ships different bloat. If you ran the prompt (or did it by hand) on a TV that isn't in
`examples/`, add it:

1. Create `examples/<brand>-<model>/debloat.txt`. Copy the format from
   `examples/xiaomi-mi-tv-4a/debloat.txt`: one package per line, grouped with a comment that says
   what the group is, and a trailing comment on anything non-obvious ("re-enable for firmware
   updates", "needed for HDMI-CEC", etc.).
2. Put the exact model name, Android version and firmware build in the header so people can tell
   whether it matches theirs. `tools/tv.py --probe` prints all three.
3. Only list packages you have actually disabled and lived with for a few days. Note anything that
   broke and what you re-enabled.
4. Add a row to `examples/README.md`.
5. If your TV's Live TV app or stock launcher has a different package name, say so in the header;
   `tools/restore.sh` and `../vibe-launcher/build-and-install.sh` accept them as arguments.

Never list packages to *uninstall*. Everything in this repo disables with `pm disable-user`, which
is reversible from the TV's own settings if the tools are gone.

## 2. Improve the prompt and tools

`PROMPT.md` is what most people will actually use. If your assistant got stuck somewhere, the fix
usually belongs in the prompt as one extra sentence, not in a script. Keep it brand-neutral; put
brand-specific knowledge in `examples/`.

`tools/tv.py` and `tools/b64push.py` exist because the stock `adb` is blocked on recent macOS. If
you find a cleaner workaround, open an issue first.

## Pull requests

- One topic per PR. Small is fine.
- Say which TV you tested on.
- No new dependencies in the tools without discussing it in an issue.
- Be kind in reviews. Most contributors here are doing this for their parents.
